[简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

An enterprise-grade, `package:http`-compatible client for Dart and Flutter with native support for **TLS Encrypted Client Hello (ECH)**, HTTP CONNECT proxies, custom PKI trust roots, and streaming transfers.

Powered by an in-process C++17 engine built on **libcurl** and **BoringSSL**, bundled seamlessly through Dart's modern build hooks (`code_assets`). **No background daemons, local listening proxies, Flutter platform channel plugins, or manual DLL loading required at runtime.**

Each native request worker posts copied response events to a Dart `ReceivePort`
through
[`NativeApi.postCObject`](https://api.dart.dev/dart-ffi/NativeApi/postCObject.html)
without polling or `NativeCallable`. Stream pauses withhold acknowledgements,
limiting unconsumed native body data to 256 KiB per request.

Cancellation stops posting and releases the request handle without waiting for
network I/O. Workers retain their state until exit; native finalizers handle
unreachable objects and isolate-group teardown. Close clients explicitly for
prompt cleanup.

## Key Features & Security Principles

- **Fail-Closed by Design**: If an `EchRoute` is configured for a destination, ECH negotiation **must** succeed. If the server does not support ECH, rejects the handshake, or presents an unusable configuration, the request fails immediately. **There is never a silent fallback to cleartext SNI.**
- **Authenticated ECH Retries**: Supports up to 2 automated ECH retries when the server responds with a valid TLS `retry_configs` rejection. Public names are strictly validated before retrying.
- **Separation of Destination Routing and SNI**: IP address overrides (`addresses`) redirect only the underlying TCP socket or proxy CONNECT tunnel. The TLS inner SNI, certificate identity verification, and HTTP `Host` header always correspond to the original requested hostname.
- **Strict TLS Verification**: Every connection strictly validates the server's certificate chain and hostname against the bundled Mozilla CA root certificates. There is **no insecure mode** or certificate bypass switch. Custom PKI roots can be explicitly loaded via `trustedRootsPem`.
- **High-Performance Build Hooks**: Build hooks (`hook/build.dart`) automatically download verified precompiled dependency SDKs for the exact target platform, compiling only the lightweight C++ bridge locally (~15 s cold build). No need to compile BoringSSL or libcurl from scratch.
- **Zero Runtime Daemons**: Communicates directly through Dart FFI within the host process memory space, avoiding child processes, socket proxy bottlenecks, and OS port conflicts.

## Getting Started

### 1. Installation

Add `ech_http` to your application's `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  ech_http: ^0.2.1
  http: ^1.6.0
```

Run `dart pub get` (or `flutter pub get`).

### 2. Basic Request with Dynamic DoH Discovery

For hosts that publish ECH configurations in their DNS HTTPS records (RFC 9460), use `DohEchResolver`:

```dart
import 'package:ech_http/ech_http.dart';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

Future<void> main() async {
  final target = Uri.parse('https://crypto.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/trace');
  final dohEndpoint = Uri.parse('https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query');

  // 1. Create a bootstrap client for DNS queries
  final bootstrap = EchClient();

  // 2. Configure the main client with DoH resolver
  final client = EchClient(
    resolver: DohEchResolver(
      client: bootstrap,
      endpoint: dohEndpoint,
      hosts: {target.host},
    ),
  );

  try {
    final response = await client.send(http.Request('GET', target));
    print('HTTP ${response.statusCode}');
    print('ECH Accepted: ${response.echAccepted}');
    print('Authenticated Retries: ${response.echRetries}');

    final body = await response.stream.bytesToString();
    print('Response:\n$body');
  } finally {
    // Always close clients when finished to release native resources
    client.close();
    bootstrap.close();
  }
}
```

### 3. Static Route & IP Overrides (Custom CDN Routing)

When using pre-distributed ECH configurations or connecting to specific origin/edge IPs:

```dart
import 'package:ech_http/ech_http.dart';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

Future<void> main() async {
  // Base64-encoded ECHConfigList
  const echConfig = 'AED+DQA85wAgACD...AAA=';

  final client = EchClient(
    resolver: StaticEchResolver({
      'my-service.example': EchRoute(
        configList: echConfig,
        // Traffic routes directly to these IPs; SNI and Host header remain 'my-service.example'
        addresses: ['198.51.100.10', '198.51.100.11'],
      ),
    }),
  );

  try {
    final response = await client.get(Uri.parse('https://my-service.example/api/v1'));
    print('Status: ${response.statusCode}');
  } finally {
    client.close();
  }
}
```

### 4. HTTP CONNECT Proxy

Pass the `proxy` URI to both the bootstrap client and application client:

```dart
final proxyUri = Uri.parse('http://127.0.0.1:7890');

final bootstrap = EchClient(proxy: proxyUri);
final client = EchClient(
  proxy: proxyUri,
  resolver: DohEchResolver(
    client: bootstrap,
    endpoint: dohEndpoint,
    hosts: {'my-service.example'},
  ),
);
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `EchClient` does not automatically inspect OS proxy settings or environment variables (`HTTP_PROXY`, `ALL_PROXY`). You must configure the `proxy` parameter explicitly.

---

## Offline Builds & Binary Caching

By default, Dart build hooks download precompiled dependency SDKs on the first build and cache them under `.dart_tool`. For CI/CD environments or reproducible offline builds, configure a shared binary cache directory in your application's `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
hooks:
  user_defines:
    ech_http:
      binary_cache: .dart_tool/ech_http_dependencies
```

- Paths are relative to the consuming project's `pubspec.yaml`.
- The build hook verifies the SHA-256 checksum of downloaded archives against `lib/src/build_support/dependencies.json`.
- Cached archives are validated on each build; any damaged or modified extracted files are automatically repaired from the cached archive.

## Operational Limits & Design Constraints

| Parameter / Feature | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Protocol** | `HTTP/1.1` | HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 are not supported in this release. |
| **Global Max In-Flight Requests (`maxConcurrentRequests`)** | `64` | Maximum native requests across all hosts within each client instance. |
| **Per-Host Max In-Flight Requests (`maxConcurrentRequestsPerHost`)** | `6` | Counted by URL hostname; different schemes and ports on that hostname share capacity. |
| **Max Response Size** | `32 MiB` | Maximum delivered body size after gzip decoding; aborts if exceeded. |
| **Max Upload Size** | `8 MiB` | Upload streams are fully buffered into native memory before dispatching. |
| **Request Timeout** | `30 s` | Per-destination attempt timeout (covers DNS connection, TLS handshake, ECH retries, and data streaming). |
| **Connect Timeout** | `10 s` | TCP connection and initial TLS handshake timeout. |
| **Compression** | Automatic gzip | Dart HttpClient negotiation and header/length semantics; `autoUncompress: false` disables decoding. Other encodings pass through. |
| **Address Failover** | Supported | Automatically fails over across `addresses` for `GET` and `HEAD` requests before receiving headers. |
| **Redirect Security** | Enforced | Rejects HTTPS-to-HTTP downgrades. Strips `Authorization`, `Cookie`, and `Host` on cross-origin redirects. |

### Concurrency scheduling

```dart
final client = EchClient(
  maxConcurrentRequests: 64,
  maxConcurrentRequestsPerHost: 6,
);
```

Requests start when both global and per-host capacity are available, releasing
both slots on completion or cancellation. The scheduler selects eligible requests
in queue order, skipping requests to saturated hosts so other hosts can proceed.
Queued requests hold no in-flight capacity, and ordering within each host is FIFO.
Both settings must be positive integers and apply independently to each client.

Hostnames are case-insensitive; proxy addresses, resolved IPs and ECH public names
do not affect accounting. HTTP/HTTPS and different ports on the same hostname
share capacity. Different hostnames remain independent even when they share an
IP or proxy. Cross-host redirects release source capacity and acquire capacity
for the destination URL's hostname. Queueing and resolver work are excluded from
`timeout`, which remains a per-destination transfer timeout.
Use `AbortableRequest` to cancel queued requests; `close()` cancels queued and
in-flight requests.

Unread or paused bodies retain the 256 KiB unacknowledged payload budget, while
completion and error events continue to be processed. Native completion or timeout
therefore releases the slot even before the body is consumed. Buffered body data
and errors remain available to the response stream's eventual listener.

### Gzip behavior

`EchClient` sends `Accept-Encoding: gzip` unless the request supplies its own
value. Like Dart `HttpClient`, `autoUncompress` defaults to `true` and decodes
only `Content-Encoding: gzip`. Setting it to `false` returns the original bytes
while retaining gzip negotiation; use `Accept-Encoding: identity` to request
an uncompressed response. Request bodies are never compressed automatically.

Response headers remain unchanged. For `send()`, `EchResponse.contentLength`
and the `Content-Length` header describe the compressed wire body, while the
stream may contain more bytes. `compressionState` reports whether gzip decoding
was selected. For buffered `get()`/`post()` responses, `contentLength` equals
`bodyBytes.length`, as in `package:http`; headers still retain wire values.

`maxResponseBytes` and the 256 KiB native delivery budget apply after decoding.
Concatenated gzip members are supported. Malformed or truncated gzip streams
fail with `EchException` (native code 61); partial bytes may already have been
emitted. Other content encodings and `.gz` files without `Content-Encoding`
pass through unchanged. Range requests follow Dart negotiation behavior;
set `identity` and/or disable decoding when encoded byte offsets must be kept.
